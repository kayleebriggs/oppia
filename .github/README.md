# [Oppia](https://www.oppia.org) [![End-to-End and Lighthouse CI performance tests](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/actions/workflows/e2e_lighthouse_performance_acceptance_tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/actions/workflows/e2e_lighthouse_performance_acceptance_tests.yml)

Oppia is an open-source platform that empowers educators and learners by providing interactive learning experiences. With a global community of contributors, Oppia delivers free educational lessons in various subjects, making quality education accessible to students worldwide. By simulating one-on-one tutoring sessions through explorations, Oppia helps learners engage in active problem-solving and receive personalized feedback, creating an impactful learning journey.


In addition to developing the Oppia platform, the team has developed free and effective [lessons](https://www.oppia.org/fractions) on basic mathematics, and we are planning to expand our educational offering to basic science and financial literacy. These lessons help learners who lack appropriate access to educational resources.

The Oppia web application is built using Python, Angular, and Google App Engine. See also:
